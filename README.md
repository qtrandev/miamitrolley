## Getting Started (iOS Only at the moment)

1) Make sure you can finish the Getting Started section of the React Native guide at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html  (took me 4 hours since I needed to update XCode)  

2) Try a test project such as AwesomeProject and make sure your 'hello world' app can run in the iOS simulator.  

3) Clone this repo.  

4) Go to this app's directory in the Terminal. Run this app using 'react-native run-ios' command.
